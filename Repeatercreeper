I am having issues with the tags at the bottom of the page for the
How to Use the Rails Content Tag Helper to Auto Generate HTML Code
and it doesn't give me any errors but the code just won't show up 
on the page. 


thanks just put something in here and maybe message me on slack @gavin_ if you find anything
